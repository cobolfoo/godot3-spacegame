# Godot3 Space Game Tutorial

It is a project that serves as a demonstration of Godot's capabilities in multi-player games.

This is a rather classic spaceship game, excellent for learning how to make your own multi-player game.
As an extra bonus, there is an implementation of a latency compensation method based on linear interpolation to smooth movements and prevent jumps.
